<h2>What is this?</h2>

Parsing binary data from Python has always been a bit of a pain, thanks to the
weirdly designed [**`struct`**][struct] module in Python's standard library.
`struct` uses format strings to specify the layout of binary data, where each
character specifies the type of data being packed/unpacked. But no can remember
the format characters to begin with! This has led to numerous packages cropping
in an attempt to solve the problem, such as:

* [**`bread`**][bread]
* [**`construct`**][construct]
* [**`structures`**][structures]

and many others. [**`pabo`**][pabo] is my response to such packages. It makes
parsing binary data so easy, anyone could do it! For example, here is how you
would parse the beginning of a PNG file to get the width and height of the
image:

```python
import pabo as pb

png = pb.Spec(
    {
        "magic": pb.Const(
            b"\x89PNG\x0d\x0a\x1a\x0a",
            pb.Bytes(8),
        ),
        "ihdr_size": pb.Int(4, endian="big"),
        "ihdr_id": pb.Const(b"IHDR", pb.Bytes(4)),
        "width": pb.Int(4, endian="big"),
        "height": pb.Int(4, endian="big"),
    }
)

data = png.parse("example.png")
```

which would return a dictionary with the parsed data, like so:

```python
{
     'magic': b'\x89PNG\r\n\x1a\n',
     'ihdr_size': 13,
     'ihdr_id': b'IHDR',
     'width': 602,
     'height': 172,
}
```

For more real examples, check out the [**`priwo`**][priwo] package, which uses
`pabo` to parse pulsar data from binary files (in fact, many of `pabo`'s
features are directly motivated by their need in `priwo`!). Documentation is in
development, so stay tuned!

<h2>Installation</h2>

Installing [**`pabo`**][pabo] is as easy as:

```bash
pip install pabo
```

<h2>Philosophy</h2>

The philosophy behind `pabo` is: be simple, yet be fast and full of features.
This implies that I deliberately avoid coding in features that are too magical
or obscure, in contrast to other packages, such as `construct`. This allows
users of `pabo` to also become contributors, since the internals of `pabo` are
clean and easy-to-understand.
